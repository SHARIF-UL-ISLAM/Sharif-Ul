            <h1><span class="mirron">SHARIF-UL-ISLAM</span> WORLD</h1>
            <h3>Describe Myself</h3>
            <h4>Diligent</h4>
            <p>I am always the first person my friends call because they know I am always there for them. Night or day,
                I
                make
                sure to take care of the people in my life. I put the same effort into making sure my work is done
                correctly,
                and I am always available to help my team members.</p>
            <h4>Innovative</h4>
            <p>I love trying new things, creating new methods, and introducing new ideas. In my previous job, I was
                responsible
                for selling waterproof phones. One day, I brought in a clear container filled with water to demo the
                waterproof
                phones. We made underwater videos and the phone still worked. Once my manager found out, he made this a
                mandatory practice for all 150 locations.</p>
            <h4>Ambitious</h4>
            <p>I tend to be very driven in my approach to life and work. Throughout college, I was active in three
                clubs,
                worked
                full time, and still managed to graduate at the top of my class. As the oldest sibling, I have always
                been
                somewhat of a leader. My brothers and sisters constantly look up to me for advice and I try to be the
                person
                others would be confident to follow.</p>
            <h4>Conscientious</h4>
            <p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have tried to practice honesty. I remember one time I found six
                Disneyland
                tickets and $200 cash in an envelope. I turned the envelope into the store where I found it. My honesty
                paid
                off
                when no one came to claim it and I was able to keep the content.</p>
            <h4>Friendly</h4>
            <p>I’ve always enjoyed meeting new people and it comes naturally to me to maintain a lot of relationships.
                I’m
                your
                typical extrovert, which has really helped me in my career. My natural networking abilities have enabled
                me
                to
                excel in sales roles such as this one.</p>
